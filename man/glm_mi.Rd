models across multiply imputed data.}
\usage{
glm_mi(
  data,
  formula = NULL,
  nimp = 5,
  impvar = NULL,
  keep.predictors = NULL,
  p.crit = 1,
  method = "RR",
  direction = NULL,
  model_type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with stacked multiple imputed datasets.
The original dataset that contains missing values must be excluded from the
dataset. The imputed datasets must be distinguished by an imputation variable,
specified under impvar, and starting by 1.}

\item{formula}{A formula object to specify the model as normally used by glm.
See under "Details" and "Examples" how these can be specified. If a formula
object is used set predictors, cat.predictors, spline.predictors or int.predictors
at the default value of NULL.}

\item{nimp}{A numerical scalar. Number of imputed datasets. Default is 5.}

\item{impvar}{A character vector. Name of the variable that distinguishes the
imputed datasets.}

\item{keep.predictors}{A single string or a vector of strings including the variables that are forced
in the model during predictor selection. All type of variables are allowed.}

\item{p.crit}{A numerical scalar. P-value selection criterium. A value of 1
provides the pooled model without selection.}

\item{method}{A character vector to indicate the pooling method for p-values to pool the
total model or used during predictor selection. This can be "RR", D1", "D2", "D3", "D4", or "MPR".
See details for more information. Default is "RR".}

\item{direction}{The direction of predictor selection, "BW" means backward selection and "FW"
means forward selection.}

\item{model_type}{A character vector for type of model, "binomial" is for logistic regression and
"linear" is for linear regression models.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{pmods} (multiply imputed models) from

\description{
\code{glm_mi} Pooling and backward or forward selection of Linear and Logistic regression
models across multiply imputed data using selection methods RR, D1, D2, D3, D4 and MPR
(without use of with function).
}
\details{
The basic pooling procedure to derive pooled coefficients, standard errors, 95
confidence intervals and p-values is Rubin's Rules (RR). However, RR is only possible when
the model includes continuous and dichotomous variables. Specific procedures are
available when the model also included categorical (> 2 categories) or restricted cubic spline
variables. These pooling methods are: “D1” is pooling of the total covariance matrix,
”D2” is pooling of Chi-square values, “D3” and "D4" is pooling Likelihood ratio statistics
(method of Meng and Rubin) and “MPR” is pooling of median p-values (MPR rule).
Spline regression coefficients are defined by using the rcs function for restricted cubic
splines of the rms package. A minimum number of 3 knots as defined under knots is required.

A typical formula object has the form \code{Outcome ~ terms}. Categorical variables has to
be defined as \code{Outcome ~ factor(variable)}, restricted cubic spline variables as
\code{Outcome ~ rcs(variable, 3)}. Interaction terms can be defined as
\code{Outcome ~ variable1*variable2} or \code{Outcome ~ variable1 + variable2 + variable1:variable2}.
All variables in the terms part have to be separated by a "+". If a formula
object is used set predictors, cat.predictors, spline.predictors or int.predictors
at the default value of NULL.
