# miceafter

The package provides statistical functions to apply simple and more advanced
statistical analyses after multiple imputation. Therefore the name 'miceafter'.
The package is an extension of the \code{mice} function. The package contains 
the \code{make_mids} function. With this function it is possible to convert 
any dataframe into a \code{mids} object. This object can be used in combination
with the \code{with.miceafter} function to apply all kind of repeated statistical
analyses. For all statistical analyses pooling functions are available.
